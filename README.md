# GA-Met-Opt-UAVSwarm
An Improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) for cooperative UAV swarm sensing in complex urban environments. The primary objective is to minimize the total mission completion time (makespan) for a fleet of UAVs operating from multiple depots to service distributed sensing tasks.
